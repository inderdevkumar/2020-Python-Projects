=============================

Explanation step wise:



Recursion concept is used here which means  " A function that calls itself during its execution. "



1)	Function used is: fcn(n ,s)

which has two arguments n and s where "n " is the number and "s " is the string 

2) As there string has value= "name" and x= 5

3) fcn(x, string)  Its a function call. which takes  x =5 and string= "name"

4)def fcn(n ,s):

This is the function defination, here it means fcn(5, "name")

5)since n=5 hence else condition is satisfied

print("here", s*n) 

It will print name 5 times as shown in output

6) fcn(n-2, s)

It will again call the function and this time it will be fcn(3, "name")

7) Again it will enter else block to print name 3 times as shown in output.

8)fcn(n-2, s)

It will again call the function and this time it will be fcn(1, "name")

9) Again it will enter else block to print name 1 time as shown in output

10) fcn(n-2, s)

It will again call the function and this time it will be fcn(-1, "name")

11) It will enter if block to print print("done", s) where s is "name"

12)  print("after all") 

It will be printed as many times the else block is satisfied, but just before the end of function

13) print("end")

At the end of program this will be printed
