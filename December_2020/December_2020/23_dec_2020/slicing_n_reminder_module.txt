Output:



Pyth Pytho honForEveryon



Reason:



>>> str1= 'PythonForEveryone'

>>> str1[0:4]											#It will slice str1 from 0th position till 4th position(Excluding 4th position)

'Pyth'



>>> str1= 'PythonForEveryone'

>>> str1[:5]												#It will slice str1 from 0th position till 5th position(Excluding 5th position)

'Pytho'



>>> str1= 'PythonForEveryone'

>>> str1[3:-1]											#It will slice str1 from 3rd position till last position(Excluding last position)

'honForEveryon'



print (str1[0:4], str1[:5], str1[3:-1])     # It will display all three in a line with space in between
















Output:



>>> 16%3

1



Reason: 16 will be divided by 3, The output will be the reminder

Here are few tips related to % operator:



A ZeroDivisionError exception is raised if the right operand is zero.
>>> 16%0

Traceback (most recent call last):

 File "<pyshell#1>", line 1, in <module>

  16%0

ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero



The result always gives the same sign as its second operand or zero.


>>> 16.5%2

0.5

>>> -16.5%2

1.5

>>> 16.5 % -2

-1.5

>>> -16%2

0

>>> 16%-2

0



The operands may be floating point numbers.
>>> 16.5%2
