A blessing in disguise A dime a dozen Beat around the bush Better late than never Bite the bullet Break a leg Let's call it a day Cut me some slack Cutting corners Out of hand, out of control Get it out of your system The benefit of the doubt Go back to the drawing board Hang in there Hit the sack It's not rocket science He's off the hook To make a long story short No pain, no gain We're having a ball You're pulling my leg Pull yourself together So far, so good Speak of the devil That's the last straw The best of both worlds Time flies when you're having fun Bent out of shape To make matters worse Under the weather You can say that again Your guess is as good as mine A Chip on Your Shoulder
